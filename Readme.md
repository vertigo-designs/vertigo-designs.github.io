# Vertigo Designs Homepage

This repository contains the vertigo-designs homepage. The page uses
[`jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [`github-pages`](https://pages.github.com/).

## Running locally

To run the website locally, follow the installation instructions and execution instructions localted
on [github's help page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

The original theme was taken from the [Bootstrap Creative (Jekyll)
theme](https://github.com/vvalchev/creative-theme-jekyll-new) and was modified to use green as
the primary color instead of orange. The unnecessary components were also stripped out.
